# Ising Model Animator (Python)

This repository contains a Python implementation of an Ising Model animator. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm used the following equations to generate data for pixel color array assignments:

<img src = "https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?&space;E=(\frac{-J}{2}*\sigma&space;_{current}*\sigma&space;_{neighbors})">


Where the following convolution matrix corresponds to:

<img src = "https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\sigma&space;_{neighbors}=\begin{bmatrix}0&1&0\\1&0&1\\0&1&0\\\end{bmatrix}">

The difference in energy if the current spin is flipped is given by:

<img src = "https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?&space;dE=-E-E=-2&space;E">

If any of the following statements are true, then the spin is flipped :

<img src = "https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?&space;dE<0">

<img src = "https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?e^\frac{-dE}{k_{b}T}>0.5">

Where 0.5 is a random number between 0 and 1, kb is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and dE is the difference in energy.

## Features

- Prompts user with animation settings and information.
- Real-time progress bar lets the user know how many frames have been compiled during rendering.
- Parallel computing with numba for optimal performance.
-  Upon completing the animation, it lets the user know that it is saved as a GIF to the directory in which the .exe file is located.
- Graphs which show total energy and magnetization vs iterations.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following libraries which are all compiled into the .exe:

- matplotlib
- tqdm
- numba
- numpy
- time

## Building and Running

### Windows

1. Download the .zip file by pressing the green "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP".
2. Extract all components of the .zip file.
3. Navigate to the folder titled "dist" and run the main.exe

### Customization

If any edits want to be made to the code navigate to the main.py file to make changes and run in a virtual environment.

## Example

Animation generated by main.exe with T = 0.5, grid size = 256, frames = 200:

![Alt text](<Ising Model for 2.0 β, 200 frames, 256 grid-1.gif>)

Graph generated for the above animation:

![Alt text](<Plot for 2.0 β, 200 frames, 256 grid.png>)


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you find a bug, have a feature request, or would like to improve the project in any way. 

For the future, I would like to implement color options for the user, faster processing with C++, and specific heat vs temperature graphs. Maybe even a real-time simulation, if possible.
